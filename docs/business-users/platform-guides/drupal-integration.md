6. Click **Save block**

### Method 2: Adding to Specific Content Pages
Perfect for adding widgets to specific articles or pages.

1. Edit the content where you want the widget
2. Look for "PassItOn Widget Settings" section (usually under "Advanced")
3. Check "Enable donation widget for this content"
4. Choose **Widget Placement**:
   - **Top of content**: Widget appears before the article
   - **Bottom of content**: Widget appears after the article
   - **Sidebar**: Widget appears in the sidebar
5. Save your content

### Method 3: Automatic Placement

7. Save configuration

## Step 4: Customize Widget Appearance

### Basic Styling Options

   - **Size**: Small, Medium, or Large
   - **Button Text**: Customize the donation button

### Advanced Styling (Ask Your Developer)
For custom colors, fonts, or layouts that match your site exactly:
1. Provide your developer with your brand guidelines
2. Ask them to create a custom widget template
3. They can override the default styling in your theme

## Step 5: Monitor Performance

### Analytics Dashboard
1. Go to **Reports > PassItOn Analytics**
2. View key metrics:
   - **Widget Views**: How many people saw your widget
   - **Click Rate**: Percentage of viewers who clicked
   - **Donations**: Successful donations through your widget
   - **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of clicks that became donations

### Understanding Your Data
- **High Views, Low Clicks**: Widget placement might need adjustment
- **High Clicks, Low Donations**: Consider adjusting suggested amounts
- **Low Overall Performance**: Try different content types or placements

## Common Widget Placements

### For Nonprofit Websites
- **Homepage**: Block in sidebar or bottom of main content
- **About Us Page**: Bottom of content with mission statement
- **News/Articles**: Automatic insertion at bottom of all articles
- **Events Page**: Top of content to encourage event-related giving

### For Educational Institutions
- **Program Pages**: Bottom of content with program-specific appeals
- **News Section**: Automatic insertion in news articles
- **Alumni Pages**: Targeted appeals for alumni engagement
- **Research Pages**: Appeals for research funding

### For Government/Municipal Sites
- **Community Programs**: Appeals for specific community initiatives
- **Parks & Recreation**: Fundraising for facility improvements
- **Public Services**: Voluntary contributions for enhanced services
- **Environmental Pages**: Appeals for sustainability projects

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Widget Not Appearing
**Problem**: Widget configured but not showing on pages
**Solutions**:
1. Check that the content type has widgets enabled
2. Verify block is assigned to the correct region
3. Check visibility settings on the block
4. Clear cache: Go to **Configuration > Performance > Clear all caches**

### "Configuration Error" Message
**Problem**: Widget shows error instead of donation form
**Solutions**:
1. Verify API credentials in **Configuration > Web Services > PassItOn Widget**
2. Test API connection
3. Check that Organization ID and API Key match your PassItOn account
4. Ensure your site uses HTTPS (not HTTP)

### Widget Loads Slowly
**Problem**: Page loading is slower with widgets
**Solutions**:
1. Enable "Load Assets Globally" in configuration
2. Use fewer widgets per page (recommend 1-2 maximum)
3. Contact your developer about caching optimization

### Permission Issues
**Problem**: Can't access widget settings
**Solutions**:
1. Contact your site administrator
2. Ask them to grant you "Create PassItOn widgets" permission
3. Go to **People > Permissions** and check PassItOn Widget permissions

## Best Practices

### Placement Strategy
1. **Start Small**: Add widgets to 2-3 key pages first
2. **Test Performance**: Monitor analytics for 2 weeks
3. **Expand Gradually**: Add to more pages based on what works
4. **Avoid Overwhelming**: Don't use more than 2 widgets per page

### Content Strategy
- **Match Content**: Place widgets on content related to your cause
- **Timing Matters**: Add to trending or popular content
- **Call to Action**: Include compelling text near your widgets
- **Regular Updates**: Refresh widget placement based on performance

### Performance Monitoring
- **Weekly Check**: Review analytics weekly for the first month
- **Monthly Reports**: Generate monthly performance reports
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Adjust placement for giving seasons
- **A/B Testing**: Try different placements and track results
