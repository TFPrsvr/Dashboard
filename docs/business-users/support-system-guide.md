```
I'm trying to change the donation widget color to match our brand 
(#FF6B35), but when I save the changes in the customizer, the 
widget still shows the default blue color. 

Steps I tried:
1. Went to Widget Customizer
2. Changed Primary Color to #FF6B35
3. Clicked Save Changes
4. Refreshed the page

The widget preview shows the new color, but the live widget on 
my website still shows blue. Using Chrome browser on Windows.
```

#### ‚ùå **Poor Descriptions**:
```
Colors don't work. Please fix.
```
